# Welcome to DeepOmics Lab

We are a multidisciplinary research team at the intersection of omics analysis 
and artificial intelligence, dedicated to developing and utilizing machine learning, 
deep learning, and bioinformatics algorithms to address the challenges of deciphering 
the structure and function of biomolecules in life omics.

The research group plans to recruit 1-2 master's and joint doctoral students each 
year and is actively seeking postdoctoral fellows and research assistants with 
backgrounds in chemistry, computer science and/or bioinformatics. Contact: jihongchao@caas.cn

## PI

Ji Hongchao, Associate Researcher, Master's Supervisor, Ph.D. in Science from Central South University. 
Joined the Shenzhen Agricultural Genomics Institute in 2022. He has received funding from 
the National Natural Science Foundation of China Youth Project, the Shenzhen City 
Outstanding Young Scientist Training Project, and other projects.   

He has published over 20 papers in international academic journals such as *Nature Communications*, 
*Cell Chemical Biology*, *Analytical Chemistry*, and *Briefings in Bioinformatics*. 
He has applied for 2 national invention patents and 1 PCT international patent. 
He serves as a reviewer for journals such as *Briefings in Bioinformatics*, *Journal 
of Chemical Information and Modeling*, *Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry*, and 
*Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems*, and guest editor for the *Metabolites*.
